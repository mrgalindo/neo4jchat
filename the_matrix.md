### The Matrix

**Written by The Wachowskis**

**[SCENE START]**

**INT. COMPUTER SCREEN**

A blinking cursor pulses in the electric darkness.

A phone rings.

TRINITY (V.O.)
> Is everything in place?

CYPHER (V.O.)
> You weren't supposed to relieve me.

TRINITY (V.O.)
> I know, but I felt like taking your shift.

CYPHER (V.O.)
> You like him, don't you? You like watching him.

TRINITY (V.O.)
> Don't be ridiculous.

CYPHER (V.O.)
> We're going to kill him. Do you understand that?

TRINITY (V.O.)
> Morpheus believes he is The One.

CYPHER (V.O.)
> Do you?

TRINITY (V.O.)
> It doesn't matter what I believe.

**INT. HOTEL ROOM**

A dark room. Several POLICE OFFICERS kick open the door.

COP
> Freeze, Police. Hands on your head. Do it. Do it now.

Trinity slowly puts her hands on her head.[1]

**EXT. HOTEL**

AGENT SMITH and AGENT BROWN, in dark suits and sunglasses, step out of a black car.[1]

AGENT SMITH
> Lieutenant...

LIEUTENANT
> Oh shit...

AGENT SMITH
> You were given _specific_ orders...

LIEUTENANT
> Hey, I'm just doing my job. You give me that juris-my-dick-tion crap, you can cram it up your ass.

AGENT SMITH
> The orders...were for your protection.

LIEUTENANT
> *laughs* I think we can handle one little girl...I sent two units...they're bringing her down now.

AGENT SMITH
> No Lieutenant, your men are already dead...

**INT. NEO'S APARTMENT**

Neo is at his computer. The words "Wake up, Neo..." appear on the screen.

NEO
> What the hell?

The screen flashes: "The Matrix has you..." and "Follow the white rabbit."[2]

**INT. CLUB**

Neo follows a woman with a white rabbit tattoo. He meets Trinity.

NEO
> Who are you?

TRINITY
> My name is Trinity.

NEO
> Trinity... *The* Trinity? The one that cracked the IRS d-base?

TRINITY
> That was a long time ago.

NEO
> Jesus.

TRINITY
> What?

NEO
> I just thought... you were a guy.

TRINITY
> Most guys do.[1]

Trinity warns Neo that he is in danger.[1]

TRINITY
> They're watching you, Neo.

NEO
> Who is?

TRINITY
> You know the question, just as I did...

NEO
> What is the Matrix?

**INT. OFFICE**

The next day, a package arrives for Neo containing a cell phone. It rings.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
> Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?

NEO
> Morpheus?

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
> Yes. I've been looking for you, Neo.[2] They're coming for you.

Neo sees Agents approaching his cubicle.[1]

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
> I can guide you, but you must do exactly as I say.[1]

Morpheus guides Neo to an empty cubicle and tells him to climb out on a scaffold. Neo, terrified, refuses.[1]

NEO
> No way! No way! This is crazy![1]

**INT. INTERROGATION ROOM**

Agent Smith interrogates Neo.

AGENT SMITH
> You've been living two lives, Mr. Anderson. In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company. You have a social security number, you pay your taxes... The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias "Neo" and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for.

Agent Smith offers to wipe his slate clean if he helps them find Morpheus. Neo refuses.

**INT. MORPHEUS'S HIDEOUT**

Neo meets Morpheus.

MORPHEUS
> I imagine that right now you're feeling a bit like Alice... tumbling down the rabbit hole?[1]

MORPHEUS
> Do you believe in fate, Neo?

NEO
> No.

MORPHEUS
> Why not?

NEO
> Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.[2]

MORPHEUS
> I know exactly what you mean.[2] Do you want to know what *it* is? The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.

NEO
> What truth?

MORPHEUS
> That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage. Born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch. A prison for your mind.

Morpheus offers Neo a choice: a red pill to see the truth, or a blue pill to return to his old life. Neo takes the red pill.
